# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project aims to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

Each entry is tagged so the version impact is clear:

- `[bugfix]` - corrects wrong behavior. Bump the patch version.
- `[feature]` - adds new, backward-compatible capability. Bump the minor version.
- `[docs]` - documentation only, no code change. No release needed (or patch).
- `[bc-break]` - changes existing behavior in a way that can break callers. Bump the major version.

Note on flags: a `[bc-break]` that only corrects an evident bug is treated as a
`[bugfix]`, not a real break, even though observable behavior changes.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- `[bugfix]` Connection: a malformed async `INFO` frame is no longer allowed to throw out of the core
  `processIncoming()` read loop. Previously a non-JSON async INFO (corruption in flight, or a non-conformant
  server push) raised an uncaught `JsonException` that aborted the read cycle and skipped delivery of the
  `MSG` frames parsed from the same chunk. The runtime INFO decode is now contained (the bad update is
  skipped and surfaced via the error listener), mirroring the dispatch-containment principle from #97.
  Handshake INFO is still validated strictly and fails the connect on bad JSON.
- `[bugfix]` WebSocket transport: the frame decoder no longer re-slices the entire remaining receive buffer
  once per frame. A single read carrying many coalesced frames is now decoded in O(total bytes) instead of
  O(frames × bytes) by advancing a cursor and trimming once, improving throughput under bursty high-fanout
  traffic. Behavior (including the "leave an incomplete trailing frame buffered" contract) is unchanged.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-06-13

### Security

- **Credential exposure via a configured `tlsContext` (#95).** Versions before 2.3.0 could transmit the
  CONNECT frame — which carries the configured credentials (token / user-password / JWT signature / NKey
  signature) — in **cleartext** when a `NatsOptions::$tlsContext` was supplied but `tlsRequired` was off,
  the DSN used the `nats://` scheme, and the server's INFO did not advertise `tls_required`. The TLS-required
  check ignored `tlsContext`, so the upgrade and the cleartext fail-safe were both skipped. Fixed: a
  configured `tlsContext` now forces the TLS upgrade (and fails fast if TLS cannot be established).
  **Upgrading is recommended for anyone using the `tlsContext` escape hatch.** See the Fixed entry below.

### Added

- `[feature]` Object Store: `ObjectStoreBucket::watch()` now accepts an optional `ObjectStoreWatchOptions`
  to select the delivery policy, mirroring the KeyValue watch matrix and the reference ObjectStore.Watch.
  With no options (`null`) the watcher stays updates-only (`deliver_policy=new`, unchanged). Passing an
  `ObjectStoreWatchOptions` instance opts into "snapshot then follow" — replay the current metadata of
  every existing object first, then live updates (`last_per_subject`, the reference default) — or full
  history (`includeHistory`) / explicit updates-only (`updatesOnly`). (#98)
- `[feature]` Services: a declared endpoint `schema` is now also surfaced in the standard `$SRV.INFO`
  response endpoint entries. ADR-32 stabilizes only PING/INFO/STATS, so spec-conformant tooling (nats CLI
  micro, nats.go) never queries the non-spec `$SRV.SCHEMA` verb; carrying the schema in INFO makes it
  discoverable. The `$SRV.SCHEMA` verb is retained for backward compatibility. (#101)

### Fixed

- `[bugfix]` Object Store: an object stored with empty/default metadata is now readable by the official
  NATS clients. Empty `metadata` was serialized as a JSON array (`"metadata":[]`), which the Go client
  rejects with "object-store meta information invalid" because it expects a `map`; the field is now omitted
  when empty (matching `omitempty`), restoring interoperability with the `nats` CLI / nats.go for the
  common default-metadata case. Verified live against the `nats` CLI. (#109)
- `[bugfix]` KeyValue: `watch()`'s `onCaughtUp` (end-of-initial-data) signal now fires on an empty or
  no-match bucket. Previously it could only fire from a delivered message reporting `num_pending = 0`, so
  with nothing to deliver it never fired and a caller blocking on it hung forever. The signal is now also
  derived from the created consumer's `num_pending` and fires immediately when the consumer starts with
  nothing pending. (#99)
- `[bugfix]` Protocol: the inbound MSG/HMSG frame bound is now coupled to the server's negotiated
  `max_payload` instead of a fixed 8 MiB. On a server with a raised `max_payload` (e.g. 16/32/64 MiB), a
  legitimately large message larger than 8 MiB was rejected as an oversized frame — throwing a
  `ProtocolException` that the connection turned into a reconnect, so the message was effectively
  undeliverable. The parser bound is raised from INFO (`max_payload` + a header-block margin, never below
  the historical 8 MiB), with a generous 64 MiB fallback when `max_payload` is unknown. (#94)
- `[bugfix]` Services: the endpoint success path no longer lets a `json_encode` failure escape the shared
  dispatch loop. A handler returning a value that cannot be JSON-encoded (binary / non-UTF-8 data, NAN/INF)
  previously threw a `JsonException` out of the subscription callback, aborting delivery for every
  subscription on the connection. The response publish is now guarded: an encode failure is recorded and
  answered with a controlled `HANDLER_ERROR`/500 reply (mirroring the handler-exception path), so one
  endpoint returning binary data can no longer take down the whole client's dispatch. (#97)
- `[bugfix]` KeyValue: `history()` no longer uses the throwing `messageMetadata()` path. A delivery
  lacking a parseable `$JS.ACK` reply subject (a control / non-conformant frame) is now skipped instead of
  throwing out of the shared dispatch loop — which would tear down delivery for every subscription on the
  connection (the same class fixed for `watch()` in #90) — and is no longer recorded as a bogus history
  entry. (#96)
- `[bugfix]` TLS: a configured `NatsOptions::$tlsContext` now correctly forces the TLS upgrade, matching
  its documented "treated as TLS-required" contract. Previously `requiresTls()` ignored `tlsContext`, so
  a `tlsContext`-only configuration over a `nats://` DSN to a server that did not advertise `tls_required`
  connected in plaintext and wrote CONNECT (carrying credentials) in cleartext. The credentials fail-safe
  now also covers this path, so a `tlsContext` whose handshake cannot establish TLS fails fast instead of
  leaking credentials. (#95)
- `[bugfix]` WebSocket: a corrupt permessage-deflate frame no longer emits an uncaught native `E_WARNING`
  from `inflate_add()`/`deflate_add()` before the typed `ProtocolException`. The warning is now suppressed
  (the return-value check already raises `ProtocolException`), so apps that promote warnings to exceptions
  get the intended `ProtocolException` instead of a generic `ErrorException` leaking from the codec. (#100)

### Documentation

- `[docs]` README "Reconnect Behavior" no longer wrongly states that publishes during reconnect are lost.
  It now documents the outbound reconnect buffer (publishes are buffered up to `reconnectBufferSize`,
  default 8 MiB, and flushed on reconnect; rejected only when the buffer is full, buffering is disabled, or
  the connection is closed/not reconnecting), with test citations. (#102)
- `[docs]` README "Configuration Option Mapping" table now lists the 11 previously-omitted `NatsOptions`
  fields — `connectionListener`, `errorListener`, `jwtProvider`, `tokenProvider`, `reconnectBufferSize`,
  `tlsContext`, `randomizeServers`, `retryOnFailedInitialConnect`, `webSocketHeaders`,
  `webSocketCompression`, `logger` — with types/defaults. `NatsOptionsTest::testDefaultsMatchDocumentedValues`
  now asserts these defaults too, keeping the table's "asserted by" claim accurate. (#103)
- `[docs]` README: new "WebSocket Transport" section (with an Index entry) showing how to wire
  `WebSocketTransport`, the `ws://` / `wss://` expectations, and the `webSocketHeaders` /
  `webSocketCompression` options. (#104)
- `[docs]` README: the Observability note now documents the typed `connectionListener` /
  `errorListener` closures, not just the PSR-3 logger. (#105)
- `[docs]` README: added a standalone-NKey authentication example (nkey + nonceSigner, no JWT) to the
  Authentication Options block. (#106)
- `[docs]` PHPDoc: `KeyWatchOptions` and `KeyValueBucket::watch()` now make clear that the
  last-per-subject "snapshot then follow" default applies only when a `KeyWatchOptions` instance is
  supplied; `watch()` called with `$options = null` is updates-only and replays nothing. (#107)
- `[docs]` PHPDoc: `ObjectInfo::$digest` is no longer described as "Server-provided" — it is the content
  digest recorded by the writing client and verified on read. (#108)
- `[docs]` Added a runnable performance baseline script (`scripts/benchmark.php`, request/reply + publish
  throughput) and a sample-results table in the README's Performance section.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-06-10

### Added

- `[feature]` Server-version awareness for version-gated features. Each feature's minimum NATS version
  is documented (PHPDoc `Requires NATS X.Y+` notes + a compatibility table in the README) and exposed
  programmatically via the new `IDCT\NATS\JetStream\FeatureSupport` registry
  (`FeatureSupport::requiredVersion('allow_atomic')` → `"2.12"`).
- `[feature]` New `IDCT\NATS\Exception\UnsupportedFeatureException` (a subclass of `JetStreamException`).
  When a JetStream request fails because the connected server is too old for a feature (the server
  rejects the config field with `unknown field "X"`), the client now raises this typed exception
  carrying the feature, the required version, and the server's reported version — instead of an opaque
  error. The detection is **reactive** (derived from the server's own response on failure); there is no
  per-request version probe. `JetStreamException` is no longer `final` so it can be specialized
  (existing `catch (JetStreamException)` handlers are unaffected).

## [2.1.1] - 2026-06-10

Verification pass for the 2.1.0 roadmap features against a live NATS 2.12.9 server.

### Fixed

- `[bugfix]` Atomic batch publish (#8): the stream-config field is **`allow_atomic`** — the server
  rejects the previously-documented `allow_atomic_publish` with `unknown field`. Corrected the
  `batch()`/`BatchPublisher` docblocks (the `BatchPublisher` code itself was already correct and is now
  verified end-to-end: a 3-message batch commits 3/3 with the `batch`/`count` ack parsed).

### Added

- Live integration tests for atomic batch publish (#8) and batched/multi Direct Get (#13), and a
  connection-level regression test for the fragmented-INFO handshake (#2, the `trim($chunk)` bug fixed
  in v1.0.1 previously had no test). Full integration suite (76 tests) passes against NATS 2.12.9.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-06-10

NATS 2.11/2.12 client feature support (roadmap milestone, GitHub issues #4–#14). All changes are
backward compatible (new optional parameters / new methods); the one behavior change (#5 delete
markers) is bug-driven and flagged `[bugfix]`, so this is a minor release.

### Changed

- `[bugfix]` Honor JetStream subject delete-markers (`Nats-Marker-Reason`: MaxAge/Remove/Purge, ADR-43,
  issue #5). A server-written delete-marker is now treated as a tombstone rather than a live value:
  `KeyValueBucket::get()` returns a `PURGE` entry with a null value (was an empty-string `PUT`),
  `getAll()` omits the key, `watch()` emits a tombstone, and `ObjectStoreBucket::watch()`/`info()` skip
  the marker. **Behavior change** (flagged `bc-break` on the issue, but bug-driven so versioned as a
  bugfix): only reachable when a stream has `subject_delete_marker_ttl` set, which this client now also
  forwards as a create option.

### Added

- `[feature]` Batched / multi Direct Get (ADR-31, issue #13). New `directGetBatch()` collects a
  multi-response Direct Get stream (terminated by a 204 EOB or `Nats-Num-Pending: 0`), and
  `directGetLastForSubjects()` fetches the latest message for many subjects in one request via
  `multi_last`. Additive — the existing per-subject bulk paths (`getAll()`/`list()`) are unchanged
  pending live verification on a 2.11+ server.
- `[feature]` Pull-consumer priority groups and richer pull options (ADR-42, issue #7).
  `fetchBatch()`/`fetchNext()` accept a `$pull` array (`group`, `id`, `min_pending`,
  `min_ack_pending`, `priority`, `max_bytes`, `no_wait`); `PullConsumerIterator` gains
  `setGroup()`/`setPriority()`/`setMinPending()`/`setMinAckPending()`/`setMaxBytes()`/`setNoWait()`
  and transparently captures the `Nats-Pin-Id` and re-pins on a 423 stale-pin status. New
  `unpinConsumer()` (CONSUMER.UNPIN) and `pinIdOf()`; consumer-create validates `priority_groups`/
  `priority_policy`.
- `[feature]` Atomic (all-or-nothing) batch publish (ADR-50, issue #8). `JetStreamContext::batch()`
  returns a `BatchPublisher`: `add()` stages messages and `commit()` sends them with a shared
  `Nats-Batch-Id`, an incrementing `Nats-Batch-Sequence`, and `Nats-Batch-Commit: 1` on the final
  message, returning a single PubAck exposing the committed `batchCount`/`batchId`. Capped at 1000
  messages; an aborted batch surfaces as a `JetStreamException`. Requires `allow_atomic_publish` on
  the stream.
- `[feature]` Multi-subject consumer filters (issue #10, NATS 2.10+). The consumer-create methods now
  accept a `filter_subjects` array (via options), validated client-side and mutually exclusive with the
  singular filter subject (combining the two is rejected with a clear error instead of an opaque server
  rejection).
- `[feature]` Distributed counter CRDT (ADR-49, issue #9). `JetStreamContext::incrementCounter()`
  publishes a `Nats-Incr` delta (signed/unsigned integer string) and returns the new total;
  `counterValue()` reads the current value via Direct Get ("0" when absent). Values are handled as
  strings (decoded with `JSON_BIGINT_AS_STRING`) so arbitrary-precision counters are not truncated.
  The target stream must be created with `allow_msg_counter` enabled.
- `[feature]` `JetStreamContext::publish()` now accepts optional message headers — a generic
  `array $headers`, a `$msgId` (`Nats-Msg-Id`) for server-side de-duplication within the stream's
  `duplicate_window` (issue #11), and a per-message `$ttl` (`Nats-TTL`; requires `allow_msg_ttl` on
  the stream — issue #4). `KeyValueBucket::put()` takes an optional per-key `$ttl`, and
  `delete()`/`purge()` take an optional tombstone TTL. TTL values (integer seconds, a Go duration
  string, or "never") are validated client-side via the new `MessageTtl` helper.
- `[feature]` Recurring and cron scheduled publishing (ADR-51, issue #6). `Schedule::every()` builds
  an `@every <interval>` expression (from an integer number of seconds or a Go-style duration string)
  and `Schedule::cron()` validates/returns a 6-field (seconds-resolution) cron expression.
  `Schedule::predefined()` returns a predefined alias (`@daily`, `@hourly`, ...).
  `JetStreamContext::publishScheduled()` now accepts `@at` (with `Z` or a numeric RFC3339 offset),
  `@every`, cron, and the predefined aliases (previously only `@at` with `Z`) and emits the optional
  `Nats-Schedule-Source`, `Nats-Schedule-Time-Zone` (cron/alias only, rejected otherwise), and
  `Nats-Schedule-Rollup: sub` headers alongside the existing
  `Nats-Schedule`/`-Target`/`-TTL`. The target stream must be created with `allow_msg_schedules`
  enabled (e.g. `createStream(..., ['allow_msg_schedules' => true])`).

## [2.0.0] - 2026-06-07

Findings from a deep review against a live NATS 2.12 server (README correctness,
real-server behavior, bugs, and performance). Object Store interoperability with
the `nats` CLI, idle-connection heartbeat survival, and request-timeout recovery
were all verified working and are unchanged.

### Fixed

- `[feature]` Added `flush()` (on `NatsClient`/`NatsConnection`): sends a PING and waits for the
  server's PONG, confirming the server has processed everything written so far (e.g. a SUBSCRIBE
  before publishing a dependent request). Bounded by the request timeout.
- `[feature]` Service endpoints accept optional per-endpoint `metadata` (`addEndpoint(..., metadata:)`),
  advertised in the `$SRV.INFO` response per the NATS micro spec.
- `[bugfix]` The protocol parser now rejects a size/sid token that would overflow a PHP int (which
  `(int)` silently saturates to `PHP_INT_MAX`) as a `ProtocolException`.
- `[bugfix]` `NkeySeedSigner` now zeroes the raw seed and key-pair buffers (`sodium_memzero`) once the
  Ed25519 key is derived; `ProtocolCodec` fails fast if a configured nkey does not match the seed
  signer's public key. The service `started` timestamp now carries sub-second precision.
- `[bugfix]` `ObjectStoreBucket::putStream()` no longer recopies the buffer tail per chunk (O(n^2)
  for a producer block much larger than `chunkSize`); it advances a read offset and compacts once per
  block. The constructor now rejects a non-positive `chunkSize` (which made `put()`/`putStream()` loop
  forever) with a `JetStreamException`.
- `[bugfix]` Object Store `info()`/`get()`/`list()` now populate `ObjectInfo::revision` from the
  record's stream sequence (the `Nats-Sequence` Direct Get header, or the `seq` of the STREAM.MSG.GET
  fallback) instead of always leaving it null.
- `[bugfix]` KeyValue/Object Store bucket names are now validated (`^[A-Za-z0-9_-]+$`); a name with
  dots or wildcards would otherwise mis-scope the backing stream subjects.
- `[bugfix]` JetStream `publish()`/`publishScheduled()` now translate a no-responders reply into a
  `JetStreamException` (code 503) — e.g. publishing to a subject not bound to any stream — so a
  `catch (JetStreamException)` no longer misses it as a bare `NatsException`.
- `[bugfix]` `drain()` now always closes the socket and clears state even if a fatal frame surfaces
  mid-flush, instead of escaping the flush loop and leaving the connection wedged in `Draining`.
- `[bugfix]` Reconnect no longer deadlocks when a subscription handler publishes during recovery.
  Subscription-replay (`drainImmediateServerFrames`) previously delivered buffered messages to user
  callbacks while still inside the reconnect critical section; a callback that published and hit a
  write failure re-entered `recoverConnection()` and awaited the in-progress reconnect, hanging the
  recovery fiber. Buffered messages are now delivered after recovery completes (outside the critical
  section), so such a callback starts a fresh recovery instead of deadlocking.
- `[bugfix]` Microservice endpoint error replies now carry the NATS micro-spec `Nats-Service-Error`
  and `Nats-Service-Error-Code` reply headers (400 for validation, 500 for handler errors), so a
  generic client (Go `micro`, `nats` CLI) detects the failure by header instead of treating the
  header-less JSON error body as success. The description is collapsed to a single line so a crafted
  message cannot break header framing; the JSON error body is unchanged.
- `[bugfix]` KeyValue `getAll()` now paginates the STREAM.INFO subjects map (via `offset`) instead
  of reading a single page, so a bucket with more keys than the server's subjects-map cap is no longer
  silently truncated (mirroring Object Store `list()`), and it now throws on a STREAM.INFO API error
  instead of swallowing it into an empty result.
- `[bugfix]` Single-record Direct Get reads now fall back to the leader `STREAM.MSG.GET` path
  when Direct Get is unavailable (a stream with `allow_direct` disabled, or an older server). The
  no-responders error is translated to a clear `JetStreamException` (code 503); KeyValue `get()` and
  Object Store `info()`/`get()` (single-chunk fast path) then retry on the leader, so reads keep
  working on interop buckets (e.g. created by the `nats` CLI without `allow_direct`) instead of
  surfacing an opaque error.
- `[bugfix]` Ordered-consumer gap detection and `streamSequenceOf()` (used for KV/Object Store
  revision) now parse the 11-token domain-qualified ACK reply subject
  (`$JS.ACK.<domain>.<account>.<stream>...` without the trailing random token), not just the 9- and
  12-token forms. Previously the sequence fell through to null on JetStream-domain/leaf deployments,
  silently disabling gap detection and revision tracking there.
- `[bugfix]` The plaintext-credentials fail-safe now also covers the handshake-first TLS path. The
  guard that refuses to write CONNECT (which carries jwt/sig/nkey/user/pass/token) over a still-plain
  socket was gated on the non-handshake-first branch, so `tlsHandshakeFirst=true` combined with no TLS
  materials (and a `nats://` DSN) while the server's INFO advertised `tls_required` could leak
  credentials in cleartext. The fail-fast now runs whenever TLS is required and the handshake did not
  establish it, regardless of `tlsHandshakeFirst`.
- `[bugfix]` A JetStream flow-control STALL heartbeat is now answered. The server leaves the message
  reply empty for a stall and puts the flow-control reply subject in the `Nats-Consumer-Stalled`
  header value; the client previously detected the stall but published to the empty reply, so the
  ack never reached the server and a throttled ordered/flow-controlled consumer could stall
  indefinitely with no error surfaced. The normal `$JS.FC.` flow-control-request reply path is
  unchanged.
- `[bugfix]` Subscription dispatch is now non-reentrant per SID. If a handler awaits on the
  connection (e.g. an ordered consumer recreating itself during gap recovery), a heartbeat tick
  or a nested `request()` self-pump could previously re-enter the per-SID drain and deliver that
  subscription's next message on top of the still-suspended handler — corrupting ordered-consumer
  recovery state (stale by-reference sequence/consumer-name → duplicate `deleteConsumer`/recreate)
  and causing overlapping/duplicate delivery. Delivery for a SID in flight is now deferred until
  the suspended handler returns (FIFO preserved); other SIDs stay deliverable so nested requests
  still complete.
- `[bugfix]` The CONNECT frame now advertises the resolved client library version (from the
  installed Composer package, with a constant fallback) instead of the stale hardcoded
  `0.1.0-dev`, so server `connz`/monitoring attributes traffic to the correct version.
- `[bugfix]` Header publishes (`publishWithHeaders()`, KV/Object Store metadata writes) now
  build and CR/LF-validate the header wire block once and reuse it for sizing and each write
  attempt, instead of re-running `toWireBlock()` two or three times per publish.
- `[bugfix]` The per-chunk subscription drain no longer rescans every subscription that has
  ever received a message: a drained (or undeliverable) per-SID queue is now released, so the
  drain stays proportional to the subscriptions with pending messages. This also fixed a latent
  coupling where the request UNSUB cleanup was gated on the (now-released) pending queue.
- `[bugfix]` Object Store `get()`/`getToCallback()` now fetch a single-chunk object with one
  Direct Get on its chunk subject, instead of creating, pulling from, and deleting a transient
  ephemeral consumer — turning the common small-object download from 4 round-trips into 1 (plus
  the metadata read). Multi-chunk objects still use the batched pull-consumer path.
- `[bugfix]` Object Store `put()` and `delete()` now run the previous-revision lookup
  concurrently with the chunk upload / tombstone publish, awaiting it only just before the
  best-effort chunk purge it feeds. Previously the lookup was a serial round-trip on the
  critical path before the first byte was written, roughly doubling small-object write
  latency. The lookup is issued at the same coroutine depth as the upload, so request
  ordering stays deterministic.
- `[bugfix]` Ephemeral push consumers (KeyValue/Object Store `watch()`, ordered consumer)
  now set an `inactive_threshold`, so the server reaps them once the subscription ends
  instead of leaking server-side consumers when a long-running app re-subscribes. An active
  subscription keeps the consumer alive; callers may override the threshold.
- `[bugfix]` `SubscriptionQueue` now bounds its polling backlog with
  `maxPendingMessagesPerSubscription` and the configured slow-consumer policy. Previously
  the connection's per-chunk drain emptied its (capped) queue into the unbounded polling
  queue, so a queue consumed slower than it was fed could grow until OOM.
- `[bugfix]` Object Store `list()` now paginates the meta-subject enumeration (via the
  STREAM.INFO `offset`) instead of reading a single page, so a bucket with more objects
  than the server's subjects-map cap is no longer silently truncated. The loop terminates
  on the first empty/duplicate page, so it is safe even against a server that ignores
  `offset`.
- `[bugfix]` `NatsHeaders::toWireBlock()` now rejects an empty/blank header name or one
  containing whitespace or a colon (previously only CR/LF were rejected, so a bad name
  silently produced a malformed/mutated block), and trims surrounding whitespace from
  values so they round-trip symmetrically with decode (which already trims).
- `[bugfix]` Object Store digest verification now compares the decoded digest *bytes*
  (tolerating missing base64url padding) with `hash_equals()`, instead of a string compare
  that spuriously rejected a byte-identical object whose metadata used unpadded base64url
  (some non-Go clients).
- `[bugfix]` KeyValue `get()`/`update()`/`delete()`/`purge()`/`getAll()` now wrap a
  malformed (non-JSON) reply in a `JetStreamException` instead of leaking a raw
  `JsonException`, consistent with `put()` and the rest of the API.
- `[bugfix]` The protocol parser now bounds an unterminated control line (no CRLF) to 1 MiB
  and raises a `ProtocolException` instead of buffering it without limit. `maxFrameSize`
  only bounded MSG/HMSG payloads (parsed after their control line completes), so a peer
  streaming bytes without a CRLF could drive the client to OOM.
- `[bugfix]` `Service::start()` is now atomic: if a subscribe fails partway, it rolls back
  the subscriptions already made and rethrows, instead of leaving the service
  half-initialized with the idempotency guard then masking a retried `start()` as a no-op.
  A separate `started` flag tracks completion.
- `[bugfix]` Microservice request observers now receive the terminal `request_end` event
  on the schema-validation rejection path too (previously only `request_start` →
  `request_error` fired), so observer spans/timers/gauges are not leaked for rejected
  (often hostile) traffic.
- `[bugfix]` `NatsClient::service()` now validates the service name
  (`^[A-Za-z0-9_-]+$`) and requires a semantic version, failing fast instead of crashing
  `start()` mid-loop or over-subscribing to discovery subjects when the name contains a
  dot/space/wildcard.
- `[bugfix]` `request()` (and every JetStream/KV/Object Store call built on it) no longer
  throws a spurious `TimeoutException` when the reply is delivered in the same event-loop
  tick the deadline fires. The wait loop now checks for completion before the deadline, so
  a reply that lands as the timeout expires is returned instead of discarded.
- `[bugfix]` Ordered-consumer gap recovery now contains a failed consumer recreate
  (pruned/deleted stream, leadership change, transient timeout) instead of throwing out of
  the shared subscription dispatch loop and aborting delivery for every other subscription
  on the connection.
- `[bugfix]` `PullConsumerIterator` infinite mode (`setIterations(null)`) now survives a
  transient `409` (`Exceeded MaxAckPending`, `Leadership Change`, `Server Shutdown`,
  `Exceeded MaxWaiting`) and keeps polling, instead of treating every non-404/408 status
  as terminal and silently exiting forever. A terminal `409 Consumer Deleted` still stops
  the loop, and finite mode is unchanged.
- `[bugfix]` `drain()` no longer busy-spins (100% CPU) or hangs when the server never
  sends the flush PONG. The flush loop now yields between empty reads so its deadline can
  fire; previously a synchronous 0-frame read starved the event loop, so the
  `TimeoutCancellation` could never fire and `drain()` never returned.
- `[bugfix]` `drain()` no longer resurrects the connection on a read failure mid-flush. A
  peer close during drain previously triggered `recoverConnection()` — reconnecting and
  re-SUBscribing the very subscriptions `drain()` had just removed (and possibly
  re-delivering messages). `processIncoming()` now skips recovery while the connection is
  `Draining` and treats the read failure as end-of-flush.
- `[bugfix]` `CredentialsParser` now parses real `nsc`-generated `.creds` files. The
  marker regex required exactly five dashes on both the BEGIN and END lines, but the
  NATS toolchain emits five dashes on BEGIN and **six** on END, so
  `CredentialsParser::fromFile()` threw `Credentials file does not contain a NATS USER
  JWT block` on essentially every genuine credentials file — making the documented
  JWT-via-`.creds` auth path unusable. Both markers now accept five-or-more dashes.
- `[bugfix]` Object Store now stores a 0-byte object with `chunks=0` and publishes no
  chunk message, matching the official Object Store layout; previously it wrote one
  empty chunk and recorded `chunks=1`. `get()` of an empty object also returns
  immediately instead of blocking until the download batch expiry waiting for a chunk
  that never arrives.
- `[bugfix]` Object Store `get()` and `getToCallback()` now return `null` for a deleted
  (tombstoned) object, consistent with a missing object and the official not-found
  semantics; the tombstone metadata remains observable via `info()`. Previously `get()`
  returned an `ObjectData` with `null` data and `getToCallback()` returned the
  `ObjectInfo`.
- `[bugfix]` Microservice handler errors no longer leak the raw exception message to the
  requester: the reply carries a generic `Internal server error` under the
  `HANDLER_ERROR` code, while the full detail stays server-side (endpoint `lastError`,
  `$SRV.STATS`, and the `request_error` observer event).
- `[bugfix]` Service `$SRV.STATS` no longer emits the non-spec `requests`/`errors`
  aliases; only the spec-compliant `num_requests`/`num_errors` remain.
- `[bugfix]` Connections now disable Nagle's algorithm (`TCP_NODELAY`). NATS is a
  small-message request/reply protocol, and Nagle combined with delayed ACKs added
  roughly 40 ms of latency per round trip; local request/reply throughput improved
  about 16x in a single-process benchmark (~22 to ~365 req/s) after this change.
- `[bugfix]` Ordered consumers (`subscribeOrderedConsumer()`) now deliver in order,
  gap-free, and without duplicates. Gap detection was based on the stream sequence,
  which is non-contiguous for a filtered consumer, so every filtered delivery looked
  like a gap; and on a gap the out-of-order message was forwarded and the expected
  sequence advanced past it, causing duplicate/out-of-order delivery and a cascading
  consumer delete+recreate storm. Detection now uses the JetStream consumer
  (delivery) sequence, the out-of-order message is discarded, and the consumer is
  recreated from the last in-order stream sequence (resuming from the next available
  message if the restart point was pruned).
- `[bugfix]` `NatsOptions` now rejects genuinely-invalid configuration at construction
  (non-positive `connectTimeoutMs`/`requestTimeoutMs`, `maxPendingMessagesPerSubscription`
  below 1, and negative reconnect/`maxPingsOut` values) with an `InvalidArgumentException`,
  instead of misbehaving later. Legitimate edge values stay valid: `pingIntervalSeconds`
  `<= 0` disables the heartbeat, `maxPingsOut` 0 is allowed, and an empty `servers` list
  falls back to the default — so this is input validation, not a breaking change.
- `[bugfix]` KeyValue keys with a leading, trailing, or consecutive dot (which produce a
  malformed `$KV.<bucket>.<key>` subject) are now rejected up front; dots, colons and
  slashes elsewhere in a key remain valid.
- `[bugfix]` Object Store `put()` now pipelines chunk publishes in bounded in-flight
  windows instead of awaiting one PubAck round-trip per chunk, so large-object uploads
  are no longer strictly round-trip-bound. PUB frames are written to the single
  connection in chunk order, so stream order (and download reassembly) is preserved.
- `[bugfix]` Single-record reads — KeyValue `get()` and Object Store `info()` (and the
  metadata read behind `get()`/`getToCallback()`) — now use the Direct Get API (served by
  any replica) instead of leader-only `STREAM.MSG.GET`, consistent with `getAll()`/`list()`.
  On clustered/replicated streams this stops concentrating reads on the stream leader. (The
  internal put/delete cleanup lookup stays on `STREAM.MSG.GET` for deterministic ordering.)
- `[bugfix]` KeyValue `getAll()` and Object Store `list()` now read the latest record
  per key/object via the Direct Get API issued concurrently, instead of N+1 sequential
  leader-only `STREAM.MSG.GET` reads. For large buckets this stops hammering the stream
  leader and collapses O(keys) serial round-trips into roughly one round-trip of
  wall-clock. (Concurrent request/reply on a single connection is covered by a new
  integration test.)
- `[bugfix]` `publish()` and `publishScheduled()` now wrap a malformed (non-JSON)
  acknowledgment in a `JetStreamException` instead of leaking a raw `JsonException`,
  consistent with the other JetStream API calls.
- `[bugfix]` Direct Get now rejects an unrecognized response (no status line and no
  `Nats-Stream`/`Nats-Sequence` headers) with a `JetStreamException` instead of
  returning a garbage body, guarding against a non-conformant server/proxy.
- `[bugfix]` KeyValue `watch()` now delivers updates through a JetStream push consumer
  (`deliver_policy=new`, ack-free) so each entry carries its `revision` (the stream
  sequence). Previously it used a plain core subscription and always reported
  `revision=null`, so a watcher could never feed an entry back into `update()`/CAS.
  Live-updates-only semantics are unchanged.
- `[feature]` `JetStreamContext::streamSequenceOf()` returns the stream sequence of a
  JetStream-delivered message (from its `$JS.ACK` reply).
- `[feature]` `ObjectStoreBucket::putStream()` uploads an object from a producer callback
  without holding the whole payload in memory (the streaming counterpart to
  `getToCallback()`): blocks of any size are re-chunked to `chunkSize`, published in bounded
  in-flight windows, and the SHA-256 digest is computed incrementally.
- `[feature]` Object Store `watch()` now delivers updates through a JetStream push consumer
  (consistent with KeyValue `watch()`) and exposes each update's stream sequence via the new
  `ObjectInfo::$revision` field. Previously it used a plain core subscription that carried no
  sequence/revision. Live-updates-only semantics (`deliver_policy=new`, ack-free) are
  unchanged; `$revision` is `null` on `ObjectInfo`s from `get()`/`info()`/`list()`.
- `[bugfix]` `Service::stop()` now tolerates a closed/lost connection: it unsubscribes
  each endpoint best-effort and always clears its subscription state, instead of
  aborting on the first failure (which leaked the remaining subscriptions and broke a
  later `start()` restart).
- `[bugfix]` `Service::addEndpoint()` now rejects a duplicate subject with an
  `InvalidArgumentException` instead of silently overwriting the earlier endpoint and
  handler (which also under-reported them in INFO/SCHEMA/STATS).
- `[bugfix]` `Service::run()` now stops when the connection is unrecoverable (closed
  for good) and backs off interruptibly, instead of busy-spinning at ~50 Hz silently
  swallowing the error.
- `[bugfix]` The microservice discovery handler now swallows an encode/publish failure
  (e.g. invalid-UTF-8 metadata) instead of throwing out of the shared dispatch loop,
  which would abort delivery of buffered frames for other subscriptions.
- `[feature]` `NatsClient::state()` exposes the current connection state.
- `[feature]` `SubscriptionQueue::unsubscribe()` / `close()` cancel the queue's own
  subscription (convenience for `$client->unsubscribe($queue->sid)`).
- `[feature]` `AmpSocketTransport` now accepts `nats://` DSNs directly (self-normalizing
  to `tcp://`), so the transport is usable standalone, not only via the connection layer.
- `[bugfix]` Object Store downloads now use a no-ack (`ack_policy=none`) consumer. The
  read-only download previously used an explicit-ack consumer and acked each chunk; on
  a slow link an ack stalling past `ack_wait` triggered redelivery, which re-hashed a
  chunk and produced a spurious digest mismatch.
- `[bugfix]` Object Store downloads now fail on a truncated transfer (fewer chunks than
  the metadata declares) via a digest-independent completeness check, instead of
  silently returning a partial object when the metadata carries no digest.
- `[bugfix]` Object Store `watch()` now tolerates a malformed metadata payload (skips
  it) instead of throwing out of the dispatch loop, which would abort delivery of
  buffered frames for other subscriptions.
- `[bugfix]` `listStreams()` and `listConsumers()` now paginate through the JetStream
  LIST API (`offset`/`total`). Previously they read only the first page, silently
  truncating accounts with more than the server page size (256) of streams, or a
  stream with more than 256 consumers.
- `[bugfix]` `PullConsumerIterator` infinite mode (`setIterations(null)`) now keeps
  polling past routine empty windows (404/408) instead of terminating on the first
  idle gap, so a long-running worker is no longer killed by a quiet period. Terminal
  errors (e.g. 409 consumer deleted) still stop the loop, and finite mode is unchanged.
- `[bugfix]` The heartbeat watchdog now resets the outstanding-ping counter only when
  an actual PONG is received, not on any inbound bytes. Previously a server that
  stopped answering PINGs but kept trickling data (or a proxy replaying buffered data)
  never tripped `maxPingsOut`, defeating dead-link detection on busy connections.
- `[bugfix]` `drain()` now waits for the server's PONG (bounded by a deadline) before
  closing, instead of bailing on a transient partial/empty read. A larger message
  split across socket reads no longer cuts the flush short and drops in-flight
  deliveries.
- `[bugfix]` `SubscriptionQueue::fetchAll()` no longer returns early on a transient
  empty read (e.g. the heartbeat self-read briefly owning the socket) while its
  configured timeout window still has time remaining.
- `[bugfix]` `recoverConnection()` now coalesces concurrent reconnect attempts. A
  suspended ping-timer callback resuming while the read path already began recovering
  can no longer launch a second reconnect that races on the parser, state, and socket.
- `[bugfix]` The protocol parser now rejects malformed frames instead of silently
  misframing the stream: non-numeric or negative MSG/HMSG sizes and sids, and HMSG
  header bytes exceeding total bytes, raise a `ProtocolException`. A parse failure now
  resyncs past the offending bytes instead of leaving them buffered to re-throw on
  every subsequent read, and `processIncoming()` treats an unparseable stream as a
  transport failure (reconnect) rather than letting the exception escape the read loop.
- `[bugfix]` The client no longer transmits credentials in plaintext to a TLS-required
  server. When the server advertises `tls_required` (or the option/`tls://` scheme
  requires TLS) but no TLS materials were configured at connect time, the previous
  code performed a no-op "upgrade" and then wrote CONNECT (token/user/pass/JWT/sig)
  over the still-plaintext socket, hanging until the handshake deadline. The client
  now fails fast with a clear error and never writes CONNECT before TLS is active.
- `[bugfix]` A graceful peer close (socket EOF) now triggers reconnect from the read
  path. `readLine()` previously collapsed the EOF `null` into an empty string, which
  the connection treated as "no data this tick", so a server restart / idle-timeout /
  load-balancer reap left the client believing it was connected to a dead socket
  (never recovering when pings are disabled, recovering only after ~90s otherwise).
  Transports now signal EOF via a `TransportClosedException`, which `processIncoming()`
  and the heartbeat self-read escalate to `recoverConnection()`.
- `[bugfix]` `SubscriptionQueue::fetch()`, `next()` (with no/zero/negative timeout),
  and `fetchAll()` (with no timeout) no longer block the calling fiber forever on an
  idle subject against a real socket. Each now bounds its single poll with a small
  cancellation, honoring the documented non-blocking contract.
- `[bugfix]` `Service::run()` now passes its cancellation into `processIncoming()`,
  not only the outer `await()`. Previously a timed/cancelled run loop left the idle
  socket read running detached, wedging the shared connection (every later read
  short-circuited and the heartbeat stalled). The read is now torn down on cancel.
- `[bugfix]` `getStreamMessage()` no longer returns an empty payload when the stored
  body is the single character `0`. The decoded body was passed through a falsy
  fallback, so a legitimate `"0"` payload was replaced with an empty string.
- `[bugfix]` `getStreamMessage()` now preserves headers stored with the message.
  Previously the stored header block was dropped and the returned message had no
  headers.
- `[bugfix]` The heartbeat keep-alive read now delivers any application message it
  happens to read while consuming the server reply, instead of leaving it buffered
  until the next manual read. This removes a rare case where a reply could be
  delayed until its own timeout.
- `[bugfix]` Microservice endpoints now default to a shared queue group (`q`) so
  multiple instances of the same service load-balance requests, matching the NATS
  micro specification. Previously every instance handled every request, which
  duplicated side effects and work across instances. **Behavior change:** with more
  than one instance, each request is now handled by exactly one of them. Pass `null`
  or `''` as the endpoint queue group to opt out and fan out to all instances.
  (Reclassified from a breaking change to a bugfix because the previous behavior
  defeated the framework's scaling model.)

### Changed

- `[feature]` Faster Object Store downloads: object chunks are pulled in bounded
  batches rather than one request/reply round-trip per chunk, which significantly
  reduces latency for large, multi-chunk objects while keeping peak memory bounded.
  Digest verification, in-order delivery, the chunk-by-chunk `getToCallback()`
  contract, and `nats` CLI interoperability are unchanged.

### Documentation

- `[docs]` Corrected the Performance Benchmark Recipe, which previously stalled after
  roughly 50 requests because the responder consumed only one transport chunk per
  request. The recipe now drives the responder with a single continuous read loop,
  and the `processIncoming()` single-chunk semantics are spelled out.
- `[docs]` Corrected the Scheduled Publish example. It now creates the backing stream
  with `allow_msg_schedules` (and `allow_msg_ttl` when a schedule TTL is used) so the
  example runs as written; without those flags the server rejects the publish.
- `[docs]` Renamed the "Stream Message Direct Get" section to "Stream Message Get" and
  clarified that `getStreamMessage()` uses the standard stream message get API (not
  the JetStream direct-get API) and preserves the stored body and headers.
